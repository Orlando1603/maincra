Tree scythe now works with more leaves from other mods - rubber ic2, biomes o plenty, and more.  Added some config file defaults for mod compatibility with tinkers construct guis.  If Altered Stone config is turned on, tools are crafted with only smoothstone, not variants.  Add recipe to reverse netherwart block.  Sound of launch enchant is less overpowering.  Uncrafting grinder speed is now in config file (cyclicmagic.cfg).  Ocean generator details in config.  New InventoryUpgradeKeepOnDeath config option to change if the extended inventory items drop on death.  Tweak dungeon finder flightpath: slower initially, flies more horizontal when far away, then goes vertical later on.  "

Fix scaffolding not dropping as an item when breaking, and increase recipe output slightly."
	,"1.7.14":"Fix Sack of Holding leaving behind ghost blocks or invisible chests when used to pick up half of a double chest.  Sack of holding now always drops the full sack on the player going both ways (instead of sometimes where the chest was, and sometimes where the player is).  Add error handing to Ender Shears to avoid ticking entity crashes, and make sure Ender Shears drops as an item when it hits a block, or a sheep that has already been sheared, or any non-sheep entity.  "
  	,"1.7.15":"Compatibility: fix Magic Bean not getting harvested by Pams Harvestcraft right-click auto-harvest feature.  Make sure Magic Bean always drops its seed when broken, fully grown or not.  Magic bean now respects drops two random items by default if broken, and respects fortune on tools.  Add a bit Magic Bean loot such as stained glass and hardened clay, a few other things (this helps dilute the really good stuff ... it still currently drops vanilla items only)."
  	,"1.7.16":"Fix potion upgrade recipes not working (ingredients changed to changed to gold & ink sacs instead of redstone/glowstone as workaround for known& reported bug in forge).  Added Hit Deposit mode to storage sack: Hit on a block to change modes, and hit on a container to deposit (if you have enabled it).  Add smelting recipes for End & Nether ores by request in case you silk touch them.  Removed key modifiers from default keybindings, (since in current forge version, the modifier cannot be removed: if you rebind to a single key, and restart,  the modifier from the default gets put back on your new key).  Fix keybindings for Extended Inventory and Inventory Crafting not closing the screens when open.  Add chat message to ender dungeon finder if no spawners are in range.  Fix Ender Book crashing servers when players used it and didn't have enough experience points."
  	,"1.7.17":"Machines with inventory now output comparator signals based on contents just like chests (affects Uncrafting Grinder, Controlled Miner, Block Placer, Structure Builder)"
  	,"1.7.18":"Fix helper buttons crashing when trying to deposit on invalid containers (such as Password Trigger).  Fix duplication bug with some some blocks (such as Quantum Storage Unit) when using Sack of Holding.  "
  	,"1.7.19":"Fix duplication bug on Storage Sack with Quantum Storage blocks again (update to build 1.7.18)"
  	,"1.7.20":"Fix Stack of Storage displaying the Items Deposited: message even when no items were moved.  Make sure identical item stacks get merged if possible when using Dump mode.  Fix Password Trigger block so it is not instamane (has hardness) and is harvestable by a pickaxe.  Ender Torch recipe now produces 32, up from 8.  "
  	,"1.7.21":"New Machine: Automated User (automated item use / right click).  Tweak tooltips on a few other machines.  "
 	,"1.7.22":"Fix Auto Fisher sometimes crashing when unloading chunks (and getting a null loot table).  Avoid ConcurrentModificationException crashes when using exchange scepters or the piston wand (now uses minecraft's vanilla built in addScheduledTask to avoid modifying server data asynchronously).  Also for these scepters increase cooldown from 8 ticks to 10.  Sack of holding now works with more stuff (for example, the machines from Extra Utilities 2).  Change default value of TerrariaInventoryButtons to false (it has caused issues with several other mods now.  Can still be re-enabled client side) "
 	,"1.8.0":"Uncrafting Grinder: Config blacklists moved from blocks category to modpacks (so no longer visible with ingame config gui);  blacklists now correctly use the modid:itemname string for vanilla and modded items; You can now blacklist an entire modid from the uncrafter.  Also no longer uncrafts enchanted items, or unenchanted items using a recipe that creates an enchanted one (Fixes the progressive automation/nether star exploit);  recipe slightly changed, 3 obsidian instead of 1;  Harvester: processing time now in config file.  Nether and End ores now have correct mining levels set (so no longer can you mine nether diamond ore with a wooden pickaxe for example).  Auto fisher now respects mending enchantment to repair fishing rods with fished exp (it already worked with luck and unbreaking and others before).  Autofisher now runs every second instead of every tick (default speed is still the same at 7% chance to catch).  Autofisher speed in config file."
  	,"1.8.1":"Fix Uncrafting Grinder BlacklistOutput not working.  Fix Cyclic machines losing their data (items, etc) when their block state gets changed (when they get rotated by some modded item).  Fix Prospector tool not detected modded ores: It now lists out every block found and its count, not just ores."
 	,"1.8.2":"Both Harvester and Garden Scythe now consume one seed from the block drops while replanting.  Cyclic Scepter: add config toggle to turn off the purple particle beam on use.  Fix Cyclic Scepter claiming to be empty and not building when actually only the first two slots were empty and others had blocks.  Redstone carrots now increase horse speed by 1% each, down from 5%.  Ender carrots now increase horse jump height by 1% each, down from 2%.  Magic Bean now grows with bonemeal.  Add config option in items category for saddles horse armor, and records to stack to 16.  "
  	,"1.8.3":"Harvester and Block Miner now have a GUI screen.  All cyclic machines that required redstone now have a redstone toggle button in their GUI: This allows you to change between two modes: Always On and Requires redstone.  Increased mining efficiency of Block Miner.  Removed the recently added stacksize 16 for records: Vanilla jukeboxes are buggy and can't handle this, causes item duplication."
  	,"1.8.4":"Fix Auto Fisher sometimes crashing when the fishing rod is empty or does not have mending.  "
  	,"1.8.5":"Harvester GUI now has two new buttons: You can change the harvest area as well as preview it.  The Harvester size is no longer in the config file.  All machine block models face the same direction in your inventory now.  New Item: Stirrups.  Add missing config for existing feature: 'F3SpawnChunkInfo' for Within Spawn or Distance from spawn chunk text on F3 menu.  Add missing config for existing feature 'F3HorseInfo'.  Fix Sack of Storage merging items with different NBT data.  Added zh_CN.lang.  Rebalanced some early game trades on Sage and Druid villagers, and added new trades at the end (new spawns not existing). "
  	,"1.8.6":"Fix Tree Scythe and Brush Scythe not working.  Fix Magic Bean not dropping its seed when at full growth.  Increased recipe output of many of the Ender projectiles.  "
  	,"1.8.7":"Added shearing block.  Added torch launcher.  Cyclic Building Scepter given a more descriptive name.   Some tool recipes changed to use quartz instead of ghast tears: Piston Scepter, Cyclic Building Scepter.  Fix Structure Builder placing leaves that decay right away.  Structure Builder and Cyclic Build Scepter now play the block place sounds as they build.  Fix Auto Torch attempting to place in liquids.  Tweaked & cleaned up a few item textures.  New Recipe and JSON Models for the Randomizer and the Exchange Scepters."
  	,"1.8.8":"Fix Uncrafting grinder bug when trying to insert into Refined Storage Interface block.  Fix Uncrafting Grinder sometimes merging items with different NBT data.  ProspectorRange now has default config value of 32 instead of 16 (doesn't affect existing config files).  Stop the thrown torches (from Ender Torch or Torch Launcher) land on non-solid surfaces (such as on leaves or flowers).  Add missing sound effect to torch launcher.  "
  	,"1.8.9":"Fix compatibility with commands and HelperFixer (compareTo issues from server logs & possible crashes running /help).  Horse upgrade carrots for speed and jump now increase at a constant rate and not a percentage; this also fix incorrect upgrading while the horse is under jump or speed potions.  "
 	,"1.8.10":"Fix the Cyclic scepter crashing the client when trying to place a block on empty space at max range and failing to play a sound effect"
  	,"1.8.11":"New Item: Ender Sack.  New Block: Interdiction Plate.  "
  	,"1.8.12":"Uncrafting Grinder GUI overhaul: New help button to identify if an item can be uncrafted, and if not it gives a reason.  It no longer tries to deposit items into containers (was incompatible with some containers, and occasionally had issues), instead has its own inventory of recipe output, which can be extracted by hoppers and pipes.  Fix timeout & delay errors in Bucket storage.  "
  	,"1.8.13":"Automated User now works on entities.  New Items: Water Froster, Water Spreader, Water Splasher.  Fix sack of holding incompatibility with storage drawers, where you would sometimes get ConcurrentModification exceptions and have the emtpy sack go to negative stack sizes.  Fix Piston Scepter letting the offhand action trigger at the same time.   "
 	,"1.8.14":"Magic Bean: Now has config file entries to disable bonemeal, and disable dropping a bean (seed item) when fully grown.  Magic Bean loot table is now entirely in the config file (so you can remove items or add modded items).  New category mobs -> mobloottable so you can tweak the bonus item drop percentage on top of just the true/false.

The blue Standard exchange scepter can now build over Air blocks like a building wand.   "
	,"1.19.10":"Updates to zh_CN.lang by mcBegins2Snow.  Broken tooltip fixed by sandtechnology.  Sneak while using GPS markers out in mid-air to wipe their location.  GPS Item now saves the side of the block clicked, and this is used in the wireless nodes and Screen Detector for items, fluid, and energy on specific sides.  Remote Lever can now be activated from within your inventory with a right-click, similar to charms.  Added the missing EnchantExpBoost config file entry.  Fixed Item Sorter ignoring the far right column.  Text Projector and Sensor Display now have a new Block Offet feature to push the text horizontally off the screen, so you can build in your own background.  Fluid storage tank now only drains downward to others of the same block, fixes not being able to pipe fluid up from the bottom.  You can now correctly sneak to avoid movement on corner pieces of conveyors. "
	,"1.19.11":"Added Nether and End ore for both Zinc and Tritanium (off by default in cyclic_ores.cfg).  Mod no longer double-saves players extended inventory in two files, it now exclusively uses the UUID.cyclicinvo files, and ignores the legacy _playername.invo files (no data loss but backup if you like).  Fluid Extraction Cables now have a fluid filter so you can whitelist or blacklist fluids.  Fixed fluid bugs in Automated User when the itemstack holds multiple buckets worth of fluid.  "
	,"1.19.12":"Fixed the Redstone toggle button resetting in Structure Builder.  Entity Detector now counts total items in the itemstacks when in Item mode.  zh_CN.lang changes from sandtechnology. ru_RU.lang changes from kellixon.  "
	,"1.19.13":"In Ender Library, books with no target no longer get stuck, sent to output slot instead (PR from brad18).  Fixed an issue with cables and Hydrogel mod. Controlled Miner now skips over liquid spaces.  "
	,"1.19.14":"New texture and model for Auto Torch by Ithronyar.  Fixed bugs in Unchant Pylon processing.  Fluid Extraction cable now stops pumping up fluid from in-world fluid blocks when its full.  Bumped to suggested forge version 14.23.5.2838.  Storage Bag only use its auto-pickup setting to grab items from world (lower-right of gui) while GUI of bag is open (could cause race-condition data loss sometimes)."
	,"1.19.15":"Fall damage nerf for Chorus.  Reduced volume of some magic items.   Fix for clumps + exp boost enchantment desyncing xp orb entities.  "
  	,"1.19.16":"Evoker Fang will now start casting at the targeted block instead of always the casters feet.  Evoker Fang will now cast when activated in mid air, does not require a block to be clicked specifically.  Updated ender fang 3D model & textures by a contributor.  "
	,"1.19.17":"updated ru_RU.lang by Bytegm.  Extractor cables are now rock material.  storage_bag now checks that the stack size is 1 before opening.  "
  	,"1.19.18":"Merge pull request #1245 from sandtechnology (Update zh_CN.lang).  Changes to crafting_food and inventory_food: They toggle off when you eat them again; and inventory buttons get hidden correclty now if you eat one then turn it off.  Fluid Extraction cables fix bug with cables resetting filter-type button after reloading world.  S:EnderBookExpCostRatio config now accepts decimals (calculations and mechanics unchanged).   "
  	,"1.19.19":"Fixed a rendering issue.  Fixed a bug with transfer nodes and Real Filing cabinets.  Cleanup some log messages.  Fixed a fluid bug with extraction cable.  Fixed visual bug where the energy bar display would stop updating when the machine was turned off.  Fixed fang spells from Evoker Fang weapon not despawning and building up entity count.   Health system internally upgraded by BlueAgent; data is now stored as a health modifier and does not edit players raw health value which means it is now fully compatible with other health systems & mods.  Reduce Packager lag by only searching for a new recipe when the inventory contents changes.   Reduce Auto Crafter lag by only searching for a new recipe when the inventory contents changes.  New command added /setfood.  Merchant Almanac GUI no longer has the JEI sidebar; this fixes the tooltip rendering issue.  New configs added AutoUserLargestTick and AutoUserSmallestTick in case servers need to restrict useage speed of the machine.  Fixed a crash if Block Miner was breaking a block and also pushed by Sticky Piston with Quark's tile entity integration.   Excavation enchant no longer crashes if some other mod forces its level past the natural maxumum (7, 100, etc).  Harvester and garden scythe now compatible with mods that use BlockCrops:getMaxAge() to override the Age property max value such as Pizzacraft. "
	,"1.19.20":"Fixed autocrafter/JEI dupe bug.  Fix game crash when slowfall is disabled.  Fixed a bug introduced in 1.19.19 causing way too many chunk updates for a single machine.  Fixed Fluid Collector pulling in the wrong fluid and in some cases building over mismatching fluids.   "
	,"1.19.21":"Fixed an obscure item dupe glitch"
	,"1.20.0":"Updated 'block placement' logic through the entire mod, so things like building scepters and machines place blocks and keep their NBT data (like shulker boxes) as well as relative player directions, also improved compatibility with any blocks having special onItemUse logic/metadata.  Workbench now quickly and cleanly syncs between multiple players using it at the same time.  Excavate no longer allows tools to go into negative durability  (correctly uses native attemptDamageItem to handle unbreaking enchant, tool damage, and tool breaking).  GPS Marker now stores specific location of the hit within the block, the players facing direction, and the block-face clicked on (shows on tooltip while holding sneak); only used by certain machines such as Structure Builder.   Structure Builder GUI changed, removed offset sliders and replaced with GPS slot; removed rotations value.  Structure builder now optionally uses the GPS markers, so you can target an offset location and set the orientation of rotating blocks such as stairs.  Structure builder Diagonal setting now uses size to build across just like a roof.   Structure builder has a new Horizontal Cylander building mode.  Renamed Cyclic building scepter to Ranged Building Scepter; it now renders an outline of the distant block that it will place.  GPS Marker now renders an outline of the selected block.  The three anvils now can be rotated like regular anvils.  Allow cables to be harvested and dropped as items when broken by hand.  Fluid Drain now has a Preview Render button to show the currently targeted block.   Rebuilt and fixed saturation potion.  Vision Helmet no longer grants glowing effect.   Interdiction Pulsar now works on hostile mobs riding non-hostile living mobs by moving their mounts (such as zombie chicken riders or mobs on horses).  Fixed pattern replicator render outline button.  Pattern replicator redesigned and now use GPS Markers to select areas to copy and paste.  Pattern replicator now builds from the bottom up so that unsupported blocks such as redstone dust or carpet builds more reliably.  Fixed issue in Exp pylon -500 button.  Each quadrant of Ender Library can store 999999 enchantments, up from 64.  Ender Library now saves its data when picked up and placed down as an item, for safe transport like a shulker box. Fixed Model Variant Exceptions showing in log file.  Fixed water candle sometimes spawning mobs in the ground or creating other duplicate blocks.  All dynamyte now uses ExplosionEvent.Start event to allow other mods to hook and cancel explosions if needed.  Piston Scepter: removed rotate mode (wooden wrench does exactly this); Piston scepter now pushes a whole line of blocks not just one, matching real piston behavior; also it checks canPlayerMove for permission hooks.  Ender Library now checks for enchanted books of stack size != 1 for mod compatibility.  Improve Storage Bag button tooltips for useability.  Storage Bag deposit updated to use capabilities (more compatible with more modded inventories for example AA Crates).  Added crystallized_amber and crystallized_obsidian to default BlacklistInput config for the uncrafter (not affecting existing modpacks but reccomended to add these values).  Updated how Forester looks for ore dictionary logWood blocks when logs have metadata (fixes Biomes o Plenty trees in forester).  Forester now skips air blocks faster.  Password Trigger now works if player is in a different dimension than the block (if blocks chunk is loaded by something).  Added configs to tweak the x/y offsets of the inventory buttons.  Added a few more refinedstorage items to SackHoldingBlacklist config (some RS blocks dont use compatible tile entity NBT storage). "
	,"1.20.1":"Fixed game crashing if FastWorkbench is not installed. "
	,"1.20.2":"Put in some checks in case a player is logging out and in with a bounce potion effects.  Item Sorter: Normal mode now matches NBT (enchantments etc); and new Ore Dictionary mode added"
	,"1.20.3":"Fixed builder consuming two blocks for every one placed.  Water walking enchant now works better against BOP quicksand (mud).  By popuplar demand, renamed 'Whitelist/Blacklist' to 'Allowlist/Ignorelist' in a few tooltips (functionality unchanged).  Added some error safeguards in case IE wires throw an exception when hit by a certain projectile.  Block the extraction of items from the Workbench using things like hoppers (fixes some exploits).  Fixed Auto User in attack mode not hitting the full area in larger sized selections.  "
	,"1.20.4":"Add config to reverse placement of machines -UnInvertedPlacement- (default value is no changes, edit to make machines face away from player on placing).  Confirmed compatibility with Guide-API-2.1.8-63 "
	,"1.20.5":"Optimize BaseEnchant calls to EnchantmentHelper and HashMap (merge PR Ricket).  Fix merchant almanac bug.  Fixed Cyclic Fluid Node Transfer Rate does not change with GUI.  Fix compatibility crash with Just a Few Fish mod.  Fix a pattern replicator block server crash bug.  Missing texture added for potion effect 'stunned'.  New config SprinklerAnimationsAllowed.  Experience pylon fill and drain logic overhauled to fix bugs; player can sneak on the pylon to drain into it.  If a player currently has the cyclic bounce potion effect bounching, and is using Multi-jump enchant as well, the horizontal momentum given from the multi-jump click is greatly reduced to avoid combining with the bounce enchant and becoming overkill.  "
	,"1.20.6":"Auto crafter now correctly moves container items to output slots and refills them (such as full buckets in cake recipe).  Boomerang fixed to not break certain strong blocks such as Reinforced glass from securitycraft when thrown.  Also Boomerang by default will no longer break blocks when flying (config boomerang.doesBreakBlocks to restore old way).  (trunksbomb) Fix Pattern Replicator to not cause out of bounds exception  "
	,"1.20.7":"If a block has its fuelcost config set to zero, it now will also hide the energy display in GUI screen, and block capability connections.  New config added for energy cost to run machine I:peat_farm=64 [range: 0 ~ 500000, default: 64] in cyclicmagic.cfg file (prevously was hardcoded 64 default).  "
	,"1.20.8":"Fixed crash introduced in 1.20.7 energy cable"
	,"1.20.9":"Fix crash in peat farm GUIs when config has I:peat_farm=0.  Fix unchant pylon leaving an empty NBT tag when all enchantments are removed (this allows unenchanted items to go through uncrafting grinder and other compatibility things).  Fix Structure Builder offset directions in CV - Circle Vertical setting.  Fix typo in Diamond and Iron spikes config.  Fix stat.killEntity.robot compatibility error. Fix Random and Pattern gui settings of the Range building scepter.  Fix Peat-fired Generator Gui energy bar not rendering bug.  "
	,"1.20.10":"PR merged from embeddedt: Prevent milk bucket from removing flight when player is in creative mode.  Catch more errors from Excavation enchant, in case game runs out of memory, StackOverflow, similar errors (errors will now just stop digging instead of crash).  Ender Shelf no longer renders the enchanted book (was causing tps/fps lag).  "
	,"1.20.11":"Fix Peat Farm block not working if the config is set to not require power (specifically setting I:peat_farm=0 )"
  	,"1.20.12":"Prevent bad/invalid entity NBT data from crashing while mob is being captured by an empty Monster Ball.  Fix excavate enchant errors on high max levels, and reduced size calculation to mc1.16.5 formula (26 + 8*LEVEL). Excavate is no longer compatible with Efficiency. Changed Structure Builder Tunnel (Circle Vertical) renamed and updated to match modern minecraft versions. Remove Saturation potion use logspam. Fix Xp Pylon server->client desync display"
  	,"1.20.13":"#2189 new forester configs to control which logs, leaves, and saplings are used by the machine, see the bottom of cyclicmagic.cfg"
  	,"1.20.14":"#2135 Port Alluring Fishhook item (cyclic:ender_fishing) from 1.10.2 to 1.12.2"
